<p>My two and a half month long trip to southeast Asia begins Kuala Lumpur.</p><p></p><p>I was lucky to fly out on 30th Nov just before Indigo decided to ground the whole country.</p><p></p><p>Anyways.</p><p></p><p>After I cleared immigration and my cab left the airport area, I felt the world around me has been upgraded to 4k. The allure of a foreign country was definitely there. The tall buildings, street art and exceptionally clean streets - my sandals had dirt on the bottom of the sole when I packed them in India, I walked in them for about an hour in KL's streets and they were squeaky clean. So not only do they not add dirt, they take away any dirt from your shoes.</p><p></p><p></p>
