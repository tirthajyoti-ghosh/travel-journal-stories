Leaving this place feels like leaving home.

I arrived at Melaka on the night of 6th. Bus ride from KL was chill, had the single window seat all to myself. A friendly volunteer from Italy checked me in and showed me around the hostel (they have free coffee!)

Ringos Foyer hostel is very close to the touristy Jonker Walk (or Jonker Street). So I quickly washed my face and headed out to the night market with a couple of guys that checked in with me.

Every week from Friday night to Sunday night, this place comes alive.
