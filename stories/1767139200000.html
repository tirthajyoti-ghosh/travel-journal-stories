<p>I left Danang on the evening of 31st Dec for my overnight bus to Dalat in the Lam Dong province of Vietnam' Central Highlands.</p><p></p><p>Electric pole on fire.</p><p>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.</p><blockquote><p>Beautiful things don't ask for attention</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>To see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind walls, to draw closer, to find each other and to feel.</p><p>That is the purpose of life.</p></blockquote><p>To just go and do things. If you can think it, you can do it!</p><p></p><p>Tea party.</p><p>Vegan dinner with a philosophy lessons:</p><ul><li><p>Life is unpredictable </p></li><li><p>By not choosing or deciding on one thing, you let the unpredictability of life to take over and more often than not you get way more than what you expected. An example: by not choosing to book an accomodation for the night opens you up to paths that leads you having one of the best nights at a local village. When you have made a choice, you have automatically discarded far better choices that you could have made.</p></li><li><p>Living in the present. Fear always takes us to a future that will never exist. Live a little in the present.</p></li><li><p>Surrender your fear. An example: fear of being alone forces us to chase connections. The more we chase the further it gets away from us.</p></li><li><p>Fear leads to thoughts about our future. Thoughts about our future leads to deciding on a path in the present. Deciding on a path in the present robs us of the infinitely better choices we could have made. Surrender your fear.</p></li></ul><p></p>
