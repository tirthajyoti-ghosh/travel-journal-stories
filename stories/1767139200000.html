<p>I left Danang on the evening of 31st Dec for my overnight bus to Dalat in the Lam Dong province of Vietnam' Central Highlands.</p><p></p><p>Electric pole on fire.</p><p>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.</p><blockquote><p>Beautiful things don't ask for attention</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>To see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind walls, to draw closer, to find each other and to feel.</p><p>That is the purpose of life.</p></blockquote><p>To just go and do things. If you can think it, you can do it!</p><p></p><p>Tea party.</p><p>Vegan dinner with a philosophy lessons:</p><ul><li><p>Life is unpredictable</p></li><li><p>By not choosing or deciding on one thing, you let the unpredictability of life to take over and more often than not you get way more than what you expected. An example: by not choosing to book an accomodation for the night opens you up to paths that leads you having one of the best nights at a local village. When you have made a choice, you have automatically discarded far better choices that you could have made.</p></li><li><p>Living in the present. Fear always takes us to a future that will never exist. Live a little in the present.</p></li><li><p>Surrender your fear. An example: fear of being alone forces us to chase connections. The more we chase the further it gets away from us.</p></li><li><p>Fear leads to thoughts about our future. Thoughts about our future leads to deciding on a path in the present. Deciding on a path in the present robs us of the infinitely better choices we could have made. Surrender your fear.</p></li></ul><p></p><p>Guess what, my tour guide (yeah yeah I did touristy things for one day, sue me) brought up Shillong. Yup! Shillong, Meghalaya. A lot of villages in the valley of Da Lat is lot like Meghalaya - the weather, people, food, even the matriarchal/matrilineal society.</p><p>Women in the man's family get buffaloes when they marry off the man. 2-3 buffaloes is the going rate but the women in both families get down on a table and negotiate on the exact number. In short, you can imagine the culture as exactly same as patriarchy, just gender roles reversed. Not the urban patriarchy you see around you, fairly deep village patriarchy.</p><p></p><p>I am in the Cu Lan village right now. Feels like I am dreaming. I uhh don't know how to put my thoughts in words. Okay here we go.</p><p>Cu Lan is located about 45 min north of Dalat city centre. The road to reach here is marvelous - curvy mountain roads, pine trees playing with sun and shadow. A group of 4 students from Saigon arrived just in time to accompany me on 4x4 offroad ride (otherwise it would have been way too expensive for me ride it alone). We took off on with our trusty offroad driver and ooooh boy was it fun.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
